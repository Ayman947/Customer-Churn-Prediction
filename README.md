# ðŸ“±ðŸ‘ªðŸ“‰ Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**Business Background:** 
- Customer churn is the tendency of customers to cancel their subscriptions to a service they have been using.
- Customer churn rate is the percentage of churned customers within a predefined time interval.
- Churn rate is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the overall business wellness of the company.



**Business Problem:** 
- At the telecom company, the marketing department detected that they are losing many of their customers (i.e. high churn rate).
- So, they decided to launch retention campaigns, and to be efficient they need to target just the customers who are about to churn.

> **Objective:** To determine the customers' tendency to churn.

> **Question:** Who will churn and who will not?

> **Analytics Solution / Methodology:** A supervised ML classification models will be built to predict the churn status of every customer.

  # **Modeling**

  - We've built **[[ML Algo]]** to predict **[[target]]** using **[[Inputs]]**.

  | HyperParameters | Values   |
  |-----------------|----------|
  |                 |          |
  |                 |          |

  - Our model's accuracy is **[[## %]]** (i.e For every 100 predictions, there are ## predictions are true.)
