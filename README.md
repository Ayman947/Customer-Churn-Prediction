# ðŸ“±ðŸ‘ªðŸ“‰ Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**Business Background:** 
- Customer churn is the tendency of customers to cancel their subscriptions to a service they have been using.
- Customer churn rate is the percentage of churned customers within a predefined time interval.
- The Churn rate is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the overall business wellness of the company.



**Business Problem:** 
- At the telecom company, the marketing department detected that they are losing many of their customers (i.e. high churn rate).
- So, they decided to launch retention campaigns, and to be efficient they need to target just the customers who are about to churn.

> **Objective:** To determine the customers' tendency to churn.

> **Question:** Who will churn and who will not?

> **Analytics Solution / Methodology:** A supervised ML classification models will be built to predict the churn status of every customer.

  # **Modeling** & **Final Results**

We've built **4 ML classification** models to predict **customers churn**:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. XGBoost (XGB)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  # **Conclusion**

- By applying the **Logistic Regression** model, we will approximately tell **who may churn** with **F-score = 0.631** and **AUC = 0.767**.

- Thus, the marketing professionals can determine the **customers to target** through the retention campaign.

- **(i.e. reduced costs & efficient business decisions)**
